\source{
Simulated data in R.
}
\description{
Includes 200 observations, 20 of which have replicates. The (Y, C) values are 
stored as a separate data frame called \code{\link{dat1}}. The data were 
generated with a true log-OR of 0.2 for X and Y, adjusted for C. The Xtilde 
measurements are subject to additive normal measurement error.
